## What is is?
`fresh` is a collection of self-contained (freestanding) programs to test basic program loading and I/O in Unix-like hobby operating systems initially developed as a userland for the [SalernOS Kernel](https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/SalernOS-Kernel), and later replaced by GNU and [mlibc](https://github.com/managarm/mlibc).

This repository includes some basic shell utilities (command interpreter, cat, echo), the scripts needed to build them, and a freestanding implementation of a subset of C Standard Library functions shared by all subprojects.

`fresh` _should_ be quite easy to port to other OSes, see `sysdeps/salernos-x86_64`.
> [!WARNING]
> `fresh` is not meant to be a replacement for existing userland suites. Do not use it as such!
